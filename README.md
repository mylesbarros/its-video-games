It's Video Games
=============

Firefox add-on that replaces occurrences of 'videogame' with 'video game' the way it was meant to be spelled.

This is forked from Doug Tabacco's origional [It's Video Games](https://github.com/tabacco/its-video-games) extension, itself a fork of Steven Frank's [Cloud-To-Butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt).

You can conveniently install the extension form the [Firefox Add-Ons site](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/its-video-games/).
