It's Video Games
=============

Firefox add-on that replaces occurrences of 'videogame' with 'video game' the way it was meant to be spelled.

This is forked from Doug Tabacco's origional [It's Video Games](https://github.com/tabacco/its-video-games) extension, itself a fork of Steven Frank's [Cloud-To-Butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt).

You can not conveniently download this add-on from anywhere, as very little has been done yet. In fact, the repository has not yet been changed in the slightest.
