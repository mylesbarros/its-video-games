It's Video Games
=============

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'videogame' with 'video game' the way it was meant to be spelled.

This is forked from and almost completely identical to Steven Frank's [Cloud-To-Butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt)

You can conveniently install it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bpljcfihdpogcmgmpboahejajkffhnfo/).
